javac  -cp lib/jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar:lib/commons-math3-3.0.jar src/folding/*.java src/writers/*.java src/plotting/*.java -d bin;

# Note: If you do not have javac on your path, you should include it before (or just give the full path to javac)
# For Windows, this might be something like:

SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60\bin

javac -cp lib/jgrapht-core-0.9.1.jar;lib/commons-math3-3.5.jar src\folding\*.java src\writers\*.java src\plotting\*.java -d bin
