This software has dependencies on some common libraries, which need to be installed first. Instructions for installation and running are found below.

email: fdannenberg/live/nl



##	*** INSTALLATION ***

Unzip the folder. The software depends on the following libraries that you should install. Dir lib/ should contain

```
commons-math3-3.0.jar or equivalent	http://commons.apache.org/
jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar or equivalent	http://jgrapht.org/ do not confuse with jgraph
junit-4.12.jar or equivalent		http://junit.org/ purely optional
```

In addition, the plotting scripts require R to run. http://www.r-project.org/



##	*** COMPILE ***

```
javac  -cp lib/jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar:lib/commons-math3-3.0.jar src/folding/*.java src/writers/*.java src/plotting/*.java -d bin; 
```


##	*** SETTINGS ***

```
THREADS=8 PATHS=20 RATE=0.4; DESIGN0="design23eAll"  DESIGN1="design23eAllEnergy" DESIGN2="methodsPaperAllPlots" DESIGN3="methodsPaperNoCooperativity";

THREADS 	# number of simulation threads
PATHS		# number of folding pathways simulated per thread
RATE 		# temp drop in celsius per minute (rate)

DESIGN0="design23eAll"			# runs 5 different designs
DESIGN1="design23eAllEnergy" 		# runs same designs with sequence-specific domain stability
DESIGN2="methodsPaperAllPlots"  	# methods paper plots and data
DESIGN3="methodsPaperNoCooperativity" 	# special SI table in the methods paper
```


##	*** RUN ***

```
java -cp bin:lib/jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar:lib/commons-math3-3.0.jar -Xmx4000m folding.Control $DESIGN0 "distance" $THREADS $PATHS $RATE;
```

Correct calls will output to the commandline something similar to the below, at which point the simulation starts to run. After the run, output is placed in the /output/ dir.
